**Bridge** is a "Human-in-the-Loop" workflow tool that connects Google Gemini (Web) directly to your local development environment. 

It allows you to code inside the browser, sync files to your local machine, execute terminal commands, and—most importantly—**automatically feed execution errors back to Gemini** for autonomous self-correction.

## ✨ Features

* **📂 File Syncing:** Automatically detects `## FILE:` blocks in Gemini's response and saves them to your disk.
* **💻 Command Execution:** Detects `## CMD:` blocks and runs them in your local terminal.
* **🔄 The "Auto-Loop" (Self-Healing):**
    * If a command fails (non-zero exit code), the tool captures the error log.
    * The extension automatically types the error back into the Gemini chat.
    * Gemini analyzes the error and generates a fix, restarting the cycle.
* **🎛️ Overlay UI:** A draggable, "Always-on-Top" widget to trigger manual syncs without leaving the browser.

## ⚠️ Security Warning

**PLEASE READ BEFORE USING:**
This tool allows a web page to execute shell commands and overwrite files on your computer.
* **Review all code** generated by Gemini before enabling the "Auto-Loop."
* **Do not** use this with untrusted prompts.
* **Sandboxing** (e.g., Docker) is recommended for the project root.
